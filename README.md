# ASLProject

In this project, we develop a real time ASL Fingerspelling translator using image processing and supervised machine learning. In the ﬁnished system, an Android smartphone is used to capture an image of a hand gesture, which is then interpreted on an online server. The ﬁnal system is able to classify 24 different fingerspelling symbols with reasonable accuracy.
